#### Description

This course unit is about programming in a web environment, which requires getting familiar with the architecture of the world wide web, in particular how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to access resources identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URL). In this regard, we will initially focus on the server-side of web applications and on creating adequate web APIs for the resources being exposed. In order to have persistent data storage capability in the web application, we use a document store, accessed directly via HTTP, which also helps to reinforce the central role of this protocol in our discussion. We then switch focus to the client-side of web applications, using both static and dynamically generated content, but keeping the subject brief, as there are subsequent course units covering this. The subjects of authentication and authorization are also introduced and allow us to end the course with a simple but completely functional web application.
The main development language throughout the course is JavaScript, supported in client-side by the browser and in server-side by Node.js. This platform provides a convenient single-threaded execution environment for processing multiple HTTP requests simultaneously, by taking full advantage of asynchronous input/output APIs. We will briefly explore traditional callback based asynchronous APIs, but will then focus on promise based APIs and on the async/await syntax, which will serve as a base for subsequent course units that will discuss and use related constructs in different programming languages.

#### Prerequisites
* At least two semesters of programming experience, using any imperative or functional language.
* Basic knowledge about IP networks.
