#### Description

In order to start programming for the web environment, it's fundamental to get familiar with the architecture of the world wide web and to understand how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to access resources identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URL). In this regard, the initial focus of this course unit is on the server-side of web applications and on creating adequate web APIs for the resources that they expose. We will build  concrete end-to-end web applications, keeping theory and practice, as well as high-level architecture and programming details, intrinsically interwined. For persistent data storage capability of these web applications, we use a document store, accessed directly via HTTP, which also helps to reinforce the central role of this protocol in the course unit. We then switch focus to the client-side of web applications, using both static and dynamically generated content, but keeping the subject brief, as there are subsequent course units covering those topics. The subjects of authentication and authorization are also introduced and allow us to end the course with concrete examples of simple but completely functional web applications.

The main development language throughout the course is JavaScript, supported in client-side by the browser and in server-side by Node.js. This platform provides a convenient single-threaded execution environment for processing multiple HTTP requests simultaneously, by taking full advantage of asynchronous input/output APIs. We will briefly explore traditional callback based asynchronous APIs, but will then focus on promise based APIs and on the async/await syntax, which will serve as a base for subsequent course units that will discuss and use related constructs in different programming languages. Special attention will also be dedicated to the software architecture and design of web applications, enriching and expanding the base knowledge and experience of students in the discipline of software engineering.

#### Prerequisites
* At least two semesters of programming experience, using an imperative or functional language.
* Basic knowledge about IP networks.
